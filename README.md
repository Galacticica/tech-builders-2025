# What Is CIVIC?
CIVIC is a website where people from a community can collaborate on all fronts. Members or businesses of a community can post events, offer volunteer oppurtunites, post projects they'd like to create and seek help, and much much more!

## Why Is This Needed?
Communities don't have a centralized way to easily communicate with other members of their community about events, help requests, etc. The most widely used workaround are Facebook groups, but a few problems arise with using these. For one, users can post practically anything they want. Additionally, Facebook gives limited control to community organizers. Our website works to eliminate both of these problems, along with many more.
